- Changelog

Caption:

+ Addition
* Fix/Change
. Note

-- Current Release

* Now file format for descriptors of exported animations is .json instead of .xml.
  . The animation sheet json contains the same data as the previous .xml format, but formatted more nicely.
  . The main bundle sheet now also contains the list of animations inside each bundle sheet, which can be used to quickly find animations referenced in the sprite sheets.

* Improved bundle animation sheets export speed, and now bundle exports occur concurrently, with multiple sheets being calculated simultaneously.
  . This should significanctly improve export time, specially in multi-core machines.

+ Improved bundle export interface to show export progress of individual sheets and cancel export routines mid-way.
+ Added ability to delete selected Animation/Animation Sheets with the Delete key on the main interface.
+ New Animation and New Animation Sheet forms now open with a default unique untitled name pre-filled in.

* Fixed issues that occurred after saving files after duplicating animations/animation sheets.
* Fixed bugs related to detection of repeated frames in animation sheets.

. FrameView
  + Added an Alt+Left Click shortcut that selects the topmost layer that owns the non-transparent pixel (alpha bigger than 0) under the mouse pointer.
  + Added scroll bars to the layers panel.
  + Added a special preset menu that is populated with the last used filter presets.
  + Added ability to collapse/expand layers in the layers panel.
  * Fixed cases of activating disabled keyboard shortcuts changing the paint tools (i.e. pressing Ctrl+Q/Ctrl+E with no previous/next frames available).
  * Fixed timeline and zoom UI elements spilling out of the visible bounds of the view.
  * Fixed color picker not picking the color sometimes.
  * Improved rendering efficiency when moving the canvas around while zoomed in.
  * Now picking colors with the Color Picker tool with the right mouse button sets the second color.
  * Removed 'ding' sound when hitting Enter while editing a layer's name.
  . Now the top-most layer is selected when a frame is opened to be edited.

. AnimationSheetView
  + Now right-clicking frames in the preview panel while 'Show individual frame bounds' option is selected displays a context menu to display frames and navigate to the corresponding animations with the frame selected on the interface when selecting.
  * Fixed changes to 'Favor ratio over area' checkbox not marking the window with changes pending state.
