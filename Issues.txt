- The layer panel does not display a vertical scroll bar when the layer views overflow the container.

- When moving slices of the image with the selection tool, the preview panel's image is not updated accordingly.

- Setting the FPS of an animation down to zero and putting it back up again freezes the animation playback.

- Sometimes, pasting an image portion on a layer pastes the image on another, non-active layer.

- Opening an animation that has 0 FPS skips the first frame over to the second on the preview panel.

- Selecting a color with the middle mouse button out of bounds results in an exception window.
